                             Life is a game you just need to it's know the rules
  
**Game Dev.** Is a very interested Track (To me at leaset) You Can make Your own World With It. Game Dev. consist of 3 basics 
branches=> (Game Programming - Art - Design) and Each one of them is more interesting than the others for make a game we use 
a platforms Called Engine it make it easy for as to make a game So you don't need to learn subjects to make a game at least
for beginner you just need to learn the engine Function & programming so what stop you for being A part of Game dev. track
just start from here.
